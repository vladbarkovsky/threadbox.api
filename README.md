# Introduction 

Threadbox is anonymous imageboard for sharing texts and images.

# Getting Started

1. Install PostgreSQL 15. Server use 'postgres' user and 'P@ssw0rd' password for connection to 'threadbox_api_dev' database.
2. Install CodeMaid extension for Visual Studio and enable automatic cleanup on save.
3. Clone `threadbox.api` repository. It is important to clone repository in the same directory as the `treadbox.front`, since api-client.ts and permissions.ts are generated by server to constant paths.
4. Launch server using 'Threadbox API' profile and Debug configuration.

API specification is available at link https://localhost:5000/api.
