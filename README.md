# Introduction

Threadbox is anonymous imageboard for sharing texts and images.

# Getting Started

1. Clone `threadbox.api` repository. It is important to clone repository in the same directory as the `treadbox.front`, since the code for connecting client to the server endpoints is generated by a constant path.

2. You may need to install .NET SDK 7.0.

3. Install PostgreSQL 15. Server use 'postgres' user and 'P@ssw0rd' password for connection to 'threadbox_api_dev' database.

4. Install CodeMaid extension and enable automatic cleanup on save.

5. Launch server using 'Threadbox API' profile and Debug configuration.

All endpoints that you add on server automatically generated on launch. See `api-client.ts` file on client.

The API specification is available at the link https://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html
